# Trip Planner

## The Problem

As an expat living in Latin America, every time I come to the USA,
there are a bunch of things I want to buy for myself.  It's less
a question of budget (well that's important) and more of a question
of logistics: the weight and size of the items to bring home.

I wind up having things shipped to family members and work buddies.
There's a lot to communicate.

Also, with only a short time in the states I need to try to figure
out which family members I'm going to see and when.  I also need
to try to plan to do things that can only happen when I'm here,
like in-person bank processes or government institutions.

Finally, I wind up kind of wasting time in each city, without having
a good plan for what restaurants to go to, parks to return to,
etc.  I'm not exactly a tourist but it would be best to try to
fit in some visits to the favorite stops in my home area.

I have a hard time planning pasalubong, and I wind up wasting luggage
space because I always need to bring enough luggage to haul all my
booty back home.

I pack the wrong gear because I'm not in touch with the current weather
etc.  

## How the problem is solved today

My wife spends weeks looking things up and trying to get my attention
and help me to remember, and a combination of Google Maps, 
Apple Reminders, Amazon wishlists, and spreadsheets to keep track
of invoices, weights, dimensions, priorities, tracking numbers,
shipping addresses, expected delivery dates.

I wind up just eating uber or cooking in my airbnb, or stopping "wherever."
I lose a lot of time because I'm really not that great at planning or
maintaining my calendar.  So when I drive around the area I wind up kind
of driving right by places I'd love to stop, just for lack of planning.

I pack basically whatever I can think of on the last day.

## Negative Consequences

Lost opportunities to connect with family and friends.
Disappointment among family members that I wasn't able to make time for them.
Failure to actually complete everything that I'd like to do while visiting.
Frustrated wife trying to plan for me and and having a hard time communicating with me.
Duplicated efforts -- my wife and I both spend time researching the same problem.

I pack poorly and show up unprepared.  I miss out on bringing gifts for my
family and friends.


## Ideal Solution

1. There should be a wishlist page with natural language descriptions of all the things I
want to get, errands that need to be run, people to connect with, and an itinerary.

2. Packing list page.
3. What to pack and what to buy there page -- meaning, of all the things that I will _need_
   while I'm there, many (soap, jacket, etc) will make sense to just purchase when I arrive.
4. A page where I can view all my itinerary stops and my routes along the way.
   We'll want to be able to have local searches going on in the background to help me
   to find food, shopping, and social possibilities in each place.
5. A contacts list with their areas and contact information
6. Detailed calendar with empty spaces where I can plan additional opportunities
7. Graphical representation of all my purchases with a volume and weight calculator.  Even better, something to reasonably estimate the number of checked bags needed in order to hold all the items.
   Ivory tower: show me which luggage each of the items goes into, to eliminate the thought from
   trying to figure out what each bag weighs.   Probably want to know the empty weight of my bags too, and maybe their models in order to look up the volumes.
8. A tracker for all of my purchased items, where I can see where they are, whether they've arrived, and whether I've picked them up.

The best would be if there was even a travel itinerary planner.  Not necessarily for
booking everything etc, but I should be able to plug in:

1. Flight dates and times
2. Turo reservation details
3. AirBnb and hotel reservation information
4. Family members and locations
5. Friends and family that I can ship to

There should be a page I can go to that will give me any weather and travel
advisory information for all the places I'm visiting.  The weather should get
updated from time to time.  If more than two weeks out, it should just look
up some average climate for the area during that time of the year.

Ideally there would be a background bot that would be capable of checking eBay,
etsy, amazon, and all over the rest of the web, tirelessly thinking of the
